# Hepatocytes-activity-distribution
The proposed set of functions are able to perform a statistical analysis of the data available from The bioIVT(R) database. 
The analysis is performed using the activity ditribution (pmol/min/Mio cells) from CYPs:
  * CYP2A6: coumarin
  * CYP2B6: bupropion
  * CYP2C8: amodiaquine
  * CYP2C9: tolbutamide
  * CYP2C19: mephenytoin
  * CYP2D6: dextromethorphan
  * CYP2E1: chlorzoxazone 
  * CYP3A4(tests.): testosterone
  * CYP3A4(MDZ): midazolam
  
  Additional analysis were reported for UGT1A1, ST (using 7-hydroxycoumarin), and AO
